# Welcome to EcoCraft Machine Learning

This is our Colab Notebook script for building a model to classify waste image.

## Let's Get Started!

Follow the steps below, and don't miss anything:
# Run on Local Computer
1. Clone this repository via the command prompt
   ```
   https://github.com/eco-craft/Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Extract EcoCraft Dataset zip file
3. Navigate to the `model_new.ipynb`
3. Go to terminal and type this
   ```
   pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn torch
   ```
5. Run the code in the notebook in the specified order, don't forget to check the dataset directory.
