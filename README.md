# Welcome to EcoCraft Machine Learning

This is our Colab Notebook script for building a model to classify waste image.

## Let's Get Started!

Follow the steps below, and don't miss anything:
# Run on Local Computer
1. Clone this repository via the command prompt
   ```
   https://github.com/eco-craft/Machine-Learning.git
   ```
2. Extract EcoCraft Dataset zip file
3. Navigate to the `model_new.ipynb`
3. Go to terminal and type this `pip install opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn torch`
4. Run the code in the notebook in the specified order, don't forget to check the dataset directory.
# Run on Colab
1. Download the notebook in this link `https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19gz5Bwl9JC1pvS5SAhil-1Bn-mNux7-R?authuser=3#scrollTo=L-IOplC8T3Zh`
2. Click copy to drive
3. Download Dataset in `https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14rlaYzfzXGF5v1FURKLtRgN1EPWCUk9S?usp=drive_link`
4. Upload dataset to your google drive
5. Change path to your drive
6. Run the code in the specific order


## How to Test the Model?
1. Go to the last code sequence in the notebook and run it. Then, input an image from the testing folder to recognize the image.
